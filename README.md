# Corda Testacles [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.manosbatsis.corda.testacles/corda-testacles-testcontainers.svg)](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/manosbatsis/corda/testacles/) 

Simple conveniences for your Corda Test Suites; because who doesn't need 
to grow some more of those. 

Currently this includes basic components for using Corda's 
[Node Driver](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.6/tutorial-integration-testing.html) 
and ([Cordform](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.6/generating-a-node.html) 
based) [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) with [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5), 
i.e. some groundwork for additional features in the works. 

Testacles supports and is tested against both Corda Open Source 
and Enterprise, from version 4.5 and up to 4.6+. If your project 
requires support for an additional version or Docker image 
feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/manosbatsis/corda-testacles/issues). 

Checkout the documentation at https://manosbatsis.github.io/corda-testacles for more info.

Please note this is a work in progress, with unstable messy 
parts and so on. A sandbox really, something to help focus while trying 
to pickup a thing or two around the bits involved and make my 
day-to-day easier.
